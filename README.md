# Maze
This is an interactive maze. You can move through the maze and be guided through it. There are textures on surfaces and moving objects and lights. It uses opengl, glew, and glm. The maze can also be spun with the mouse using a trackball interface. There is a first and third person view. You can also get a first person view of a ride. A mini map is shown in the corner along with your current position.
